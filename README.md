# FORCE
Official implementation of FORCE algorithm from *Progressive Skeletonization: Trimming more fat from a network at initialization* (https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09081)

## Requirements
You can create a conda environment with all the necessary libraries with the command:
    
    conda create --name myenv --file conda-env.txt

You will need to download the Tiny-Imagenet and Imagenet datasets. For Tiny-Imagenet modify the path specified in `experiments/datasets.py` For Imagenet you will need to specify it when runing the code.

## Examples

### CIFAR and Tiny Imagenet datasets
To run an experiment with CIFAR10/100 or Tiny Imagenet datasets, run:

    python train_cifar_tiny_imagenet.py --network_name vgg19 --pruning_factor 0.01 --prune_method 1 --dataset CIFAR10 --num_steps 60 --mode exp --num_batches 1
    
Alternatively, you can change the `--dataset` option with `CIFAR100` or `tiny_imagenet`. You may also change the architecture and use `resnet50` for instance. 

### Imagenet
To run an experiment with Imagenet run:

    python train_imagenet.py /path_to_dataset/ --network-name resnet50 --pruning_factor 0.05 --prune_method 1 --num_steps 60 --mode exp --num_batches 40 --epochs 90
